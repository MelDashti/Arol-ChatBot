        "## Evaluating Results\n",
        "Here we will evaluate the fine tuned chatbot's performance using precision and recall with cosine similarity by using a seprate dataset for evaluation that wasn't used during training so that we see how the models behaves with unseen data.\n",
        "We choose to evaluate our AI chatbot using precision and recall with cosine similarity to ensure it provides accurate product information. Precision measures the relevance of the chatbot's responses, guaranteeing that users receive correct information, while recall assesses its ability to capture all relevant responses, minimizing missed information. Cosine similarity evaluates the semantic similarity between the chatbot's responses and the correct information, which is essential since users may phrase their questions differently. This approach ensures that the chatbot understands and responds appropriately to diverse inquiries, making it well-suited for a corporate environment where context and accuracy are critical. Overall, this evaluation method provides a comprehensive assessment of the chatbot's performance in delivering relevant product information.\n",
        "We did not use BLEU score for evaluation because it focuses on exact n-gram overlaps, which can penalize semantically correct responses that differ in wording. This limitation makes it less suitable for our chatbot, which needs to provide contextually relevant and accurate product information, regardless of variations in user queries. Instead, precision, recall, and cosine similarity better capture the chatbot's effectiveness in understanding and responding to diverse inquiries."
